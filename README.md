# Intro

The repository shows an example layout of a separate Firebolt-SDK repository for C++, where all 3 SDKs are combined together. It was built based on the SDKs (core, manage, discovery) generated by [`firebolt-apis`](https://github.com/rdkcentral/firebolt-apis) on the [`next-bidirectional`](https://github.com/rdkcentral/firebolt-apis/tree/next-bidirectional) branch.

# Usage

```

# Structure of Directories
* `api/` - placeholder for generated API, i.e. code generated by [`firebolt-apis`](https://github.com/rdkcentral/firebolt-apis)
* `src/` & `include/` - static part, as in [`firebolt-openrpc`](https://github.com/rdkcentral/firebolt-openrpc), in [`languages/cpp/src/shared/src`](https://github.com/rdkcentral/firebolt-openrpc/tree/next-bidirectional/languages/cpp/src/shared)
* `test/` - tests, as in [`firebolt-apis`](https://github.com/rdkcentral/firebolt-apis), in [`src/sdks/<core|manage|discovery>/src/cpp/sdk/cpptest`](https://github.com/rdkcentral/firebolt-apis/tree/next-bidirectional/src/sdks/core/src/cpp/sdk/cpptest)
